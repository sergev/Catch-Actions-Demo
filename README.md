![Python package](https://github.com/sergev/Pytest-Actions-Demo/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

Here you can find a demo of a C++ application with an automated testing using Github Actions service.

Anytime you want to start a new project in C++, feel free to use this code as a skeleton.
Copy the contents to your repository and build your code upon it.

File demo.cpp contains a code for fibonacci() function.

File test_demo.cpp has a few tests to make sure the fibonacci() function works correctly.

To test the code from command line, run:

    make check

After every commit, visit the Actions tab and review the results of automated testing.
